# EvoCELL 2019

## Introduction

This syllabus covers material that [Casey Dunn](http://dunnlab.org) will present, with help from Cat Munro, at the 2019 EvoCELL workshop.

These days will include morning workshops on general computing skills based on the book [Practical Computing for Biologists](http://www.sinauer.com/practical-computing-for-biologists.html). These will be taught be [Casey Dunn](http://dunnlab.org). Morning workshops will be followed by afternoon workshops on specific applications of bioinformatics.

A few general notes about the course structure:

- Many details of the course are specific to UNIX-like operating systems, which include Linux and Apple macOS.

- We will also use UNIX for local command line, programing, and data processing exercises. This means that it will not be possible to use Microsoft Windows alone for most course activities. If your primary laptop is Microsoft Windows, there are a couple options. We suggest that you borrow a Mac laptop for the course. Alternatively, if you prefer you can install Linux on a Virtual Machine and run it from within Windows.

- Course content, schedule, code, and other files will be distributed on [github](https://github.com). Course materials are available at [neptune2016](https://github.com/neptune2016).


## To do before you arrive


- Bring a copy of [Practical Computing for Biologists](http://www.sinauer.com/practical-computing-for-biologists.html) (abbreviated in this document as PCfB). Complete the reading for the first class (see Schedule below) prior to arrival. Also download an familiarize yourself with the [example files](http://practicalcomputing.org) provided at the [book website](http://practicalcomputing.org).


- Create a [github](https://github.com) account. If you use an academic email address, you may be eligible for free upgrades.

- Install the required software listed below.


## Required software

Please install the following tools on your laptop before you arrive. This will reduce network load during the course, and also allow us to get started right away.

### All operating systems

- [Atom](https://atom.io) text editor

- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)


### Apple macOS

- OS X command line developer tools. To see if you have them installed, open /Applications/Utilities/Terminal and type `gcc` at the command line. If `gcc` runs, you are probably all set. If it asks you if you would like to install the Developer tools, follow the instructions to do so.

### Windows

- [git](https://git-scm.com)

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## Instructions

### Git

## Schedule

This syllabus focuses on the 3 classes to be taught by Casey. These classes are from XXX on each of the following days.
