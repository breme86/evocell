## Changes for next time:

Students really wanted more phylogenetics intro - e.g tree building rather than tree thinking. ML vs BI (probably not time in one week)

Students were very keen to cover python (probably not time in one week)

Docker was really hard to implement as students needed to download the docker image at the same time. Have them load it up in advance.

## Things that worked well:

Lots of breaks were very helpful, gave students time to catch up & clarify things that they didn't understand.
